To run the cityBuzzer application:
1. clone the repo (you probably have already)
2. open a client that runs php code (in our case we have chosen MAMP), set the source directory to the cityBuzzer folder
3. go to localhost:8888

We have used a bootstrapped html/css template designed by SOMEONE

Dependencies:

	php
	valid twitter and google maps api credentials (included in account for @uzebeckatrente, these will eventually expire/require renewal)
